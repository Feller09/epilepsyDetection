Data : 

The dataset contain 5 directories ,each with 100 files and each file represents a single patient. Each file is recording of brain activity for 23.6 seconds ,and the time-series for the data is then sampled into 4097 sampling points.

So total is :
500 individuals 
Each individual has 4097 data points for 23.5 seconds


Now the 4097 data points have been shuffled into 23 chunks and each chunk contains 178 data-points  for 1 second ,and each data point is the value of the EEG recording at a different point of time.

So now : 
23*500 = 11500 pieces of information(rows), 
and each information contains 178 data points for 1s(col).
Last col represents label :- y{1,2,3,4,5}

Response varibale is y in col 179 ,the Explanatory varibales X1,X2....,X178, y contains the category of the 178 -dimensional input vector.

In the y vector ({1,2,3,4,5}), the values represent the following:-

5 - eyes open, means when they were recording the EEG signal of the brain the patient had their eyes open
4 - eyes closed, means when they were recording the EEG signal the patient had their eyes closed
3 - Yes they identify where the region of the tumor was in the brain and recording the EEG activity from the healthy brain area
2 - They recorded the EEG from the area where the tumor was located
1 - Recording of seizure activity

So ,all patients falling in 2,3,4and 5 are subjects who did not have epileptic signs.

Only the subjects in 1 have epileptic signs.
