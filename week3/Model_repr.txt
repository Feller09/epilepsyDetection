The Model Representation:

The job of this model is to binarily classify the signal as epileptical or not. 
We have considered the data to be clean and assumed that only class 1 can have epilepsy.

The case for a non-epileptic signal being rise to epilepsy has not been considered in this model.

The model creation: 
1.First the data is visualized for all the 5 classes on the plotted graph.

2. Then using a relu function and dividing the dataset into 11 parts of 
each 256,128,128,64,32,32,32,16,16,8,5 each size .
The Dense function is a function call in keras to just create the regular densely connected NN layer.The activation function used here was relu , as it is the most genral function ... other functions can also be used to improve the performance.
(Later as i read , I should have used sigmoid with softmax as the give a better prediction value for categorical data forms.)


3. For the model the optimizer was used as adam and the loss function was binary crossentropy.

4. Trainied the data for 50 epochs and each batch size of 15 and random shuffling set to False , so they are inputted in the neural network as same as the data set they are eneterd into data.csv .
